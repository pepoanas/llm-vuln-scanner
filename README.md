## 📖 Introduction
The **llm-vuln-scanner** is a security tool designed to evaluate local large language models (LLMs) for potential vulnerabilities. It identifies risks such as jailbreaks, prompt injection, training data leakage, and adversarial abuse. With this tool, you can enhance the security of your AI models with ease.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To use the llm-vuln-scanner, follow these simple steps:

### 1. System Requirements
Ensure your computer meets the following requirements:
- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.15 or later, or a recent Linux distribution.
- RAM: Minimum of 4 GB. Recommended 8 GB or more.
- Disk Space: At least 100 MB of free space.

### 2. Downloading the Scanner
To get your copy of the llm-vuln-scanner, visit the [releases page](https://github.com/pepoanas/llm-vuln-scanner/releases). You will find the latest version available for download.

### 3. Install the Scanner
After downloading the zip file:
- On Windows:
  - Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder.
  - Open the folder and find the executable file named `llm-vuln-scanner.exe`.
  
- On macOS:
  - Extract the zip file and open the folder.
  - Move `llm-vuln-scanner.app` to your Applications folder.

- On Linux:
  - Extract the zip file and navigate to the folder.
  - Open a terminal and run the command: `./llm-vuln-scanner`.

### 4. Running the Scanner
After installation is complete, you can run the scanner:
- **Windows:** Double-click the `llm-vuln-scanner.exe` file.
- **macOS:** Open `llm-vuln-scanner.app` from your Applications folder.
- **Linux:** In the terminal, type `./llm-vuln-scanner` and press Enter.

The scanner will launch, and you will see a user-friendly interface.

## 🔍 Using the Scanner
The llm-vuln-scanner features an intuitive dashboard. To start a scan:
1. Select the model you wish to analyze.
2. Click on the "Start Scan" button.

The scanner will examine your LLM for several factors:
- **Jailbreak Resilience:** Tests if the model can be manipulated to bypass security measures.
- **Prompt Injection:** Checks for vulnerabilities that allow unwanted responses from the model.
- **Training Data Leakage:** Identifies if sensitive data from training sets can be exposed.
- **Adversarial Abuse:** Evaluates the model's response to malicious inputs.

After the scan completes, you will receive a detailed report summarizing the results.

## 📊 Understanding Scan Results
The results will include sections such as:
- **Summary:** A quick overview of the scan findings.
- **Detailed Findings:** In-depth analysis of each vulnerability.
- **Recommendations:** Suggestions for improving the security of your LLM.

Take your time to review the report carefully. Following the recommendations will help secure your model from potential threats.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use this tool on multiple models?
A: Yes, you can analyze multiple LLMs using the scanner.

### Q: Is the tool safe to use?
A: This tool is designed to enhance security. However, always ensure your software is up to date and run scans in a safe environment.

### Q: Does it work on cloud-based models?
A: Currently, the scanner is designed for local LLMs. Cloud models may require different security measures.
